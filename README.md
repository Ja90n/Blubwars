# Blubwars
Hello, I am Blub the maker of blubwars. I have called it blubwars because it is a battle between people to defend their cats and the name is an oath to my minecraft cat Blub. 


This plugin features: a bed and not a cat, original and fun items to get the upper hand (you will know what i mean after playing), arena join signs, a join countdown, multiple map support, pretty gui's and lost more!


You do have to put [FastAsyncWorldEdit](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/fast-async-worldedit.13932/) in your server to play this minigame so that the arena reset can work.
